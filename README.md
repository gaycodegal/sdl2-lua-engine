Sprite(Texture, sx, sy, sw, sh, x, y, w, h)
- move(x, y)
- size(w, h)

Texture(source)

First push, successfully bound Lua and SDL2 on Linux. Planning to implement sprites, tweens, text, and music into Lua. I may incorporate some support for bezier curves possibly and possibly very basic support for something like synfig studio's .sif animation format tying in work from a previous project.

Sorry for the mess, just pushing as a save point.
